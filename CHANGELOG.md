## [0.3.29] Public Beta - 2020-04-29

- Adds support for interfaces and implements statememts. More info in this [issue](https://github.com/jwikman/nab-al-tools/issues/36)

## [0.3.28] Public Beta - 2020-04-03

- Fixes issue where `NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf` could produce a target as `[NAB: SUGGESTION][NAB: NOT TRANSLATED]`

## [0.3.27] Public Beta - 2020-04-02

- New setting `NAB.MatchTranslation`, solves the issue [Automatic search for similar translations](https://github.com/jwikman/nab-al-tools/issues/9)
  - If enabled, the `NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf` function tries to match sources in the translated xlf file to reuse translations.
  - A found match of "source" will be copied and prefixed with `[NAB: SUGGESTION]` for manual review.
  - If several matches are found, all matches are added and you need delete the ones you do not want.
  - Use `NAB: Find next untranslated text` (Ctrl+Alt+U) or `NAB: Find multiple targets in XLF files` to review all matches
  - This feature only works if `NAB.UseExternalTranslationTool` is disabled.
  - This setting is enabled as default
- New feature `NAB: Match translations from external XLF file`, solves the issue [Match translated texts from an external xlf file](https://github.com/jwikman/nab-al-tools/issues/31)
  - Use this to match your source texts with another xlf file (with a matching target language) to find translation suggestions. All found matches will be prefixed with `[NAB: SUGGESTION]`
- New feature `NAB: Find multiple targets in XLF files`
  - Use this command to find all places where you've got multiple targets, caused by the matching finding multiple sources with different translations

## [0.3.26] Public Beta - 2020-03-31

- New setting `NAB.SearchOnlyXlfFiles`
  - If enabled, the `NAB:Find Untranslated texts` function only searches *.xlf files. Be aware of that the *.xlf file filter remains in "Find in Files" after this command has been run. This should be enabled in large projects (as Base Application) for performance reasons.
- New snippet `tistemporarycheck`
  - This check prevents that a temporary parameter that is passed by reference (var) is called with a record that is not temporary.
- Dependency updates
