## Features

### XLIFF Tools

The workflow for working with these XLIFF tools are

1. Write your code
1. Build your app, so that the g.xlf file gets updated
1. Execute "NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf" from the Command Palette
1. Execute "NAB: Find next untranslated text" from the Command Palette and handle the untranslated/modified translation until you've handled them all

#### NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf

Iterates the g.xlf file and updates all language xlf files. The default behavior is to insert the tags mentioned below. If the setting `NAB.UseExternalTranslationTool == true` the `state` attribute of `<target>` is modified instead.

* The xlf files gets the same ordering as g.xlf
* Translations marked as translate=no gets removed
* Modified translations gets prefixed with [NAB: REVIEW] or `<target state="needs-adaptation">`.
* New translations with the same source language as g.xlf gets copied to target, but prefixed with [NAB: REVIEW] or `<target state="needs-review-translation">`.
* New translations with other source language than g.xlf is replaced with [NAB: NOT TRANSLATED] or `<target state="new">`
* If the setting `NAB.MatchTranslation` is enabled and a not translated text is found, it tries to match the source texts to find if this text has been translated before. Read more in the `NAB.MatchTranslation` setting.

_Please create an issue if you have an opinion of how the target states should be used or if you wish to see more functionality that improves the workflow when working with translation tools._

![Refresh XLF files from g.xlf](images/gifs/RefreshFromGXlfCorrection.gif)

#### NAB: Match translations from external XLF file

Works similar as `NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf`, but you will first need to select another xlf file to use for matching (read more about matching in the `NAB.MatchTranslation` setting documentation).

* Only xlf files with the same target language as the selected xlf file will be modified.

#### NAB: Find next untranslated text (Ctrl+Alt+U)

Finds the next occurrence of the tags [NAB: NOT TRANSLATED] or [NAB: REVIEW] and selects the tag.

* If the tag [NAB: NOT TRANSLATED] is selected, replace it with the translated text
* If the tag [NAB: REVIEW] is selected, review the translation and update if needed, then you remove the tag
* If the tag [NAB: SUGGESTION] is selected, review the suggested translation (added by source matching) and update if needed, then you remove the tag

If the setting `NAB.UseExternalTranslationTool` is set to `true` it searches for any target with a state that is considered not completed. Which is any state except `final`, `signed-off`, `translated`. The [NAB:*]-tags are not used when this setting is activated.

#### NAB: Find untranslated texts

Uses the Find in Files feature to search for translation units in need of review or translation.
*Please read Known Issues below.*

#### NAB: Find multiple targets in XLF files

Use this command to find all places where you've got multiple targets, caused by the matching finding multiple sources with different translations
*Please read Known Issues below.*

#### NAB: Find translated texts of current line

Place the cursor on a AL code line that should be translated and execute this command to use the Find in Files feature to find all occurences of the translations.
*Please read Known Issues below.*

![Find translated texts of current line](images/gifs/FindTranslatedTextsOfCurrentLine.gif)

#### NAB: Find code source of current line ("F12" in xlf files)

Place the cursor somewhere in a trans-unit node in the xlf file and execute this command to navigate to the source code for that translation.

![Find code source of current line](images/gifs/FindSourceCodeOfCurrentLine.gif)

#### NAB: Sort XLF files as g.xlf

Updates all language xlf files with the same sorting as the g.xlf file

#### NAB: Copy \<source\> to \<target\>

Copies the content of the \<source\> element to the \<target\> element. Use this when positioned on a target line in a xlf file.

#### NAB: Update g.xlf

Updates the g.xlf file from AL files. Practical if you need to update translations when you don't have all symbols to compile the solution.
All new trans-units will be placed in the bottom of the g.xlf file. When a build is done later, the g.xlf will be sorted in the correct way. Use the functions `NAB: Sort XLF files as g.xlf` or `NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf` to sort the translated files in the same way as g.xlf.
The only case where this function will remove an existing trans-unit from the g.xlf file is if a text has been changed to Locked = true.

### Other Features

#### NAB: Suggest ToolTips

Inserts a ToolTip stub on page fields and actions. The stub will be commented out and needs to be reviewed, updated and un-commented manually.
This function only works when you're in a file that has a Page och Page extension object
No ToolTips will be added on fields on NavigatePages or API pages

#### NAB: Show next suggested ToolTip

Shows the next ToolTip stub in the current Page or PageExtension. Default shortcut Ctrl+Alt+P

#### NAB: Generate ToolTip Documentation

Generates a MarkDown (.md) file with the ToolTips for all Pages and Page Extensions. All fields and action are listed per object. Empty or missing ToolTips will be included.

Fields and Actions with captions will be included in the documentation. If there are no Caption on the Page Field, the function tries to retrieve the Caption from the Source Table. This only works for tables inside the workspace.

The following naming standard in the object descriptor of Page Extensions is required to retrieve the captions from the Table Extension if there are no explicit Caption on the page field:

Pattern: `pageextension [Object ID] "[Object Name]" extends "[Base Page]" // [Base Page Object Id] ([Base Table Object Id])`

Example: `pageextension 50000 "My Item Card" extends "Item Card" // 30 (27)`

The following PageTypes are ignored:

* API
* ConfirmationDialog
* HeadlinePart
* NavigatePage
* ReportPreview
* ReportProcessingOnly
* RoleCenter
* StandardDialog
* XmlPort

Two settings can be used to ignore specific Pages or Page Extensions:

* NAB.TooltipDocsIgnorePageExtensionIds
* NAB.TooltipDocsIgnorePageIds

#### NAB: Uninstall dependent apps

Uninstalls dependent apps through PowerShell. Useful if you cannot install your app due to dependencies.

Only works for local installations, not Docker, not Saas Sandbox.

#### NAB: Sign app file

Sign the app file (matching your current app.json). You must first have the Code Signing Certificate installed in the Current User Personal Store (Cert:\CurrentUser\My if you're importing with PowerShell).

#### NAB: Deploy and Run TestTool without Debugger

Useful if you're using a separate app as a test app

Requirements:

* Must be using a workspace
* The main app's workspace folder must be called "App"
* The test app's workspace folder must be called "TestApp"

When this command is  executed, VSCode...

* Updates the launch.json in both App and TestApp to only contain the first configuration (the original launch.json is copied to ".vscode\\launch_bak.json) to avoid the prompt
* Uninstalls all dependent apps (of your main app)
* Build and deploy Main App
* Build and deploy Test App
* Uses the first configuration in the launch.json of the TestApp to eventually launch the web client, without debugging. Tip: Configure this to run page 130401!
* Restores the original launch.json

#### NAB: Deploy and Run TestTool with Debugger

The same feature as above, but with debugging

### Snippets

#### Assign text variable with CopyStr

Since CodeCop rule AA0139 complains on possible overflow, we need to assign text variables with a CopyStr statement

#### Test Codeunit

Inserts a stub Test Codeunit

#### Test Function

Inserts a stub Test Function

#### Test SendNotificationHandler

Inserts a generic SendNotificationHandler function

#### Test MessageHandler

Inserts a generic MessageHandler function

#### Test ConfirmHandler

Inserts a generic ConfirmHandler function

#### Declare Dictionary

Define variable of type Dictionary

#### Declare List

Define variable of type List

#### Declare Enum value

Declare enum value with caption.

## Requirements

This extension requires the [Microsoft AL Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al "AL Language") to fully work.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `NAB.SigningCertificateName`: The name of the certificate used to sing app files. The certificate needs to be installed to the Personal store. For instructions on how to install the pfx certificate in the Personal Store, go to [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/importing-an-spc-into-a-certificate-store).
* `NAB.SignToolPath`: The full path to signtool.exe, used for signing app files. If this is not set the extension tries to find it on the default locations, if the signtool.exe is not found it tries to download and install signtool.
* `NAB.UseExternalTranslationTool`: Modifies the state-attribute of the translation unit when running `NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf` instead of inserting a searchable string. Useful when working with external translation software.
* `NAB.ReplaceSelfClosingXlfTags`: Replaces self closing tags like `<tag/>` with a separate closing tag `</tag>`. Activated by default.
* `NAB.SearchOnlyXlfFiles`: If enabled, the `NAB:Find Untranslated texts` function only searches \*.xlf files. Be aware of that the \*.xlf file filter remains in "Find in Files" after this command has been run. This should be enabled in large projects (as Base Application) for performance reasons.
* `NAB.MatchTranslation`: If enabled, the `NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf` function tries to match sources in the translated xlf file to reuse translations. A found match of "source" is then prefixed with `[NAB: SUGGESTION]` for manual review. If several matches are found, all matches are added as targets and you need delete the ones you do not want. Use `NAB: Find next untranslated text` (Ctrl+Alt+U) or `NAB: Find multiple targets in XLF files` to review all matches. This feature only works if "UseExternalTranslationTool" is disabled. Activated by default.

## Known Issues

The Find in Files API was a bit [buggy](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/29405) before VSCode v1.34... I had to create a [PR for VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/71626) for this to work properly and in VSCode v1.34 this was finally released, yey! So be sure to update VSCode to v1.34 or later.
