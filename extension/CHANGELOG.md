## [0.3.36] Public Beta - 2020-11-25

- New functions:

    - Practical if you need to update translations when you don't have all symbols to compile the solution.

  - `NAB: Download Base App Translation files`
    - Downloads Base App translations matching the target-language of the XLF files in the current workspace. The files downloaded consists of json files with a size of 5-10mb. The files are downloaded to the VS Code extension folder and should not be visible or otherwise affect your workspace. *This feature is a preview and will likely be removed in the future to be handled in the background where needed*.

- New setting `NAB.MatchTranslation`, solves the issue [Automatic search for similar translations](https://github.com/jwikman/nab-al-tools/issues/9)
  - If enabled, the `NAB: Refresh XLF files from g.xlf` function tries to match sources in the translated xlf file to reuse translations.
  - A found match of "source" will be copied and prefixed with `[NAB: SUGGESTION]` for manual review.
  - If several matches are found, all matches are added and you need delete the ones you do not want.

## [0.3.26] Public Beta - 2020-03-31

- New setting `NAB.SearchOnlyXlfFiles`
  - If enabled, the `NAB:Find Untranslated texts` function only searches \*.xlf files. Be aware of that the \*.xlf file filter remains in "Find in Files" after this command has been run. This should be enabled in large projects (as Base Application) for performance reasons.
